## Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Discover of Nextjs with Netlify ["Jamstack explorers"](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/nextjs) mission

**Thoughts:** I really like the SSR framework using Reactjs. I wasn't lost at all. Easy to go through. Can't wait to make a project with it and mongoDB for exemple

### Day 2: January 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Discover of Composition API with Netlify ["Jamstack explorers"](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/launching-with-composition-api) mission

**Thoughts:** It was really fun to learn with a sample of "Among Us" tasks dashboard. I'm not sure about how to work properly with fork and pull-request. I have some difficulties to not interfer with netlify repo when I push my code on my own fork... need to learn more about that
