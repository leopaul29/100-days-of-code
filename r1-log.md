**Today's Progress**: Discover of Nextjs with Netlify ["Jamstack explorers"](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/nextjs) mission

**Today's Progress**: Discover of Composition API with Netlify ["Jamstack explorers"](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/launching-with-composition-api) mission

**Thoughts:** It was really fun to learn with a sample of "Among Us" tasks dashboard. I'm not sure about how to work properly with fork and pull-request. I have some difficulties to not interfer with netlify repo when I push my code on my own fork... need to learn more about that
