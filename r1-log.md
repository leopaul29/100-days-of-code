## Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Discover of Nextjs with Netlify ["Jamstack explorers"](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/nextjs) mission

**Thoughts:** I really like the SSR framework using Reactjs. I wasn't lost at all. Easy to go through. Can't wait to make a project with it and mongoDB for exemple
